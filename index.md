### About

**Monday 22th of January: BIDS Educational Day** 

This day is devoted to onboarding and training for researchers covering the basics of the BIDS standard, as well as more focused hands-on sessions in the afternoon. While being educational, this remains BrainHack, so feel free to bring along data to curate them, or try BIDS apps.

- **Morning Session: The BIDS Standard**
   - Terminology and Data Structure: source, raw, derivatives
   - Generic BIDS tools

- **Afternoon Session: Parallel tracks**
   - *PET-BIDS*: hands-on demonstrations of BIDS tooling for PET data
      - Data Curation: Tools for helping you more easily convert your data to BIDS.
      - BIDS Apps: How to get the most out of your BIDS datasets, with existing and upcoming tools.

   - *BIDS derivatives:* organizing and describing outputs of computations performed on brain imaging data
      - Electrophysiology derivatives
      - MRI derivatives

The Educational Day can be attended independently if you do not wish to remain for the rest of BrainHack.

**23rd and 24th January: Hackathon/Unconference** 

These days are devoted to projects, getting help with applying lessons learned during the BIDS educational day, or anything else you want, in total unconference style. 

--> book your travel and accommodation (i.e. from your own budget); we have secured the hackathon room in a nice hotel and we have the breakfast and lunch covered :-)
